# Bring OpenAI GPT INSIDE Excel
Use Office Scripts to connect to OpenAI's GPT model so you can ask questions and get answers inside Excel.
Also use Office Scripts to break up the answer into multiple rows in case the answer is more than one line.
You'll find the multiple row version in the "Result" tab.
